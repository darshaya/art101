                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The goal of this lab was to delve even further into our understanding of JavaScript by creating a function that depends on conditionals. </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> Similar to my partner I had trouble implenting my jQuery in Javascript. The code would not function when I just used jQuery so I had to combine both Java Script style and jQuery in my JSCode and it seemed to work. But I wanted to know why my jQuery does not work in JS Code unless inputed a certain way. Even if I mimic what the professor does it still would not work. </p>

                <p>Please enter your name for sorting: </p>
