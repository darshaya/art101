					<p> Honestly, the whole concept was confusing for and still is. If it weren't for the professors screenshot, I would be completely lost on how to start, where to start, which functions, strings, arrays, objects, commas, semicolons to even use. But I will watch more videos to understand the importants of each of them for Javascript. The Javascript functions I seem to have an issue with understanding their purposes.But once I understand the concepts and what they're used for I think i'll be fine. </p>
