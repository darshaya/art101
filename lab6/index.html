					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to further practice Javascript by experimenting with arrays and objects</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The biggest issue I had was with using the strings for the "return" statement in Javascript. I was not quite sure how to properly utilize any of those functions, so when it would no compute in the console I was experiencing difficulties finding the solution. I am still doing research on how to properly use each function for Javascript.</p>
